Stop being bothered by generic emails sent by some random agency that bought your address to some random growth hackers.

## What the hell are you talking about ?

Have you ever received an email claiming that you are the perfect candidate to some (undescribed) job position ? Wierd, because you made sure that your email address couldn't be found anywhere on the Internet, carefully hiding from any spam. Nonetheless, someone managed to find it and sent you a very blank email, leaving you in a terrible confusion whether to flag the email as spam or just forgetting about it.

If this does ring a bell, you're in my situation. I've been comitting to numberous GitHub repositories before realizing that I've been doing it with my professionnal email address.

Harvesting a user base with some email addresses found in the Internet is a job. Growth hackers/recruters will often source their candidates from GitHub. Just look at this search result : https://www.google.com/search?q=github+user+sourcing.

## How to check if you're exposed ?

TODO:

* `git log | grep "Author:" | cut -d "<" -f2 | cut -d ">" -f1 | sort --unique`
* Online tool with GitHub OAuth looking for all email addresses.
