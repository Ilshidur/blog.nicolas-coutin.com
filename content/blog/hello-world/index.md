I just made this blog. But I don't have anything to post. So let's shitpost on my own website :

I'll introduce myself to you, poor innocent who got lost on the Internet and encountered this page.

I was born in 1995, that makes me a 24 years old guy. As this blog is static, this page will show "24 years old" for the rest of its life, 'cause I don't wanna update this particular page every 24th February.

I come from [Savoie, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoie) and I love [raclette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raclette).

![Some delicious raclette](./raclette.jpg)

> Raclette /rəˈklɛt/ is a semi-hard cheese that is usually fashioned into a wheel of about 6 kg (13 lb). The Alpine cow milk based dairy product is most commonly used for melting, but is also consumed as a slice. Raclette is a Swiss dish, also very popular in Savoie (France), based on heating the cheese and scraping off (from French: racler) the melted part.

**Here's the thing :** I do web development. Particularly *backend development*. I don't go out very often. My hobbies are ... programming (**NO KIDDING**), video games, cooking, ... Ugh ... I swear I have hobbies. I like [Deathcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathcore), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) links and random enumerations.

Back to serious things.

I enjoy **JavaScript** & **Go** :

* JavaScript is my go-to language for backend because it makes my life easier building reactive apps, handling I/O and building APIs. In the front end, I like to use **React** & **Vue**.
* Go is my new love, although I still have a lot to learn about it.

I'm keen on the DevOps culture and I happen to use some DevOps tools like **Kubernetes**, **Terraform** and **Ansible**.

My goal is to keep improving myself. I always work in a motivated team, making my way through challenges & deadlines. I'd rather make things in a good way than in a quicker but ugly way.

That's all.

In case you got lost and read this whole post, I suggest you to keep browsing the Internet, particularly [GitHub](https://github.com), my favorite website.
